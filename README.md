Normal steps to build for target environment.

#####File -> Build Settings -> Set Platform(if needed) -> Build
This will create the XCode project for iOS, or the Eclipse project for Android

Normal way you would run an XCode or Android project.
> NOTE: you will need to run Unity projects on a device, the simulator will produce unexpected results.
